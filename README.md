## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Yaroslav Baienko, a **DevOps Engineer** and **Microservices engineer (Python and Go) with a passion for building scalable microservices and cloud infrastructure solutions. My career has taken me from law to technology, and today I work with modern tools and technologies that enable reliable and efficient software delivery. I specialize in **Python** and **Go** and have extensive experience working with containerized environments and CI/CD pipelines.

### ðŸš€ What Iâ€™m currently working on:
- Leading DevOps initiatives at **SALVE LLC**, where I design and maintain cloud-based, scalable infrastructures.
- Developing efficient, microservice-based solutions in **Go** and **Python**, and integrating machine learning models into production systems.
- Automating infrastructure deployments with **Terraform**, **Ansible**, and **Docker** to ensure smooth CI/CD processes.
  
### ðŸŒ± My Go Programming Inspiration:
I was drawn to **Go** by its simplicity and efficiency, especially in the context of **microservices**. Working with complex systems often requires tools that are not just powerful but also easy to maintain. **Go**â€™s native concurrency model and its ability to handle high-load applications with minimal memory usage made it the ideal choice for me. Since I started using Go, I have built numerous microservices that power cloud-based platforms and run in production environments, scaling effortlessly.

### ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:
- **Go** and **Python** for building microservices and automation scripts.
- Managing cloud infrastructure with **AWS**, **Terraform**, and **Kubernetes**.
- **CI/CD pipelines** using **Jenkins**, **GitHub Actions**, and **GitLab CI**.
- Building and managing **containerized applications** with **Docker** and **LXC**.
